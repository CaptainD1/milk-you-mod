# I Can Milk You

Made for TurtyWurty's 2023 meme modding competition.

Plays a video clip of Markiplier saying "I can milk you" whenever you hold an empty bucket while looking at a cow.

Additionally, whenever you start drinking a bucket of milk, a clip of Luke Skywalker drinking milk plays on screen.

The mod is fully configurable, though the opacity and scale settings require a game restart to take effect because I'm too lazy to fix it right now.

By default, there is a 10-second cooldown between each time it plays "I can milk you" so the player doesn't get spammed.
